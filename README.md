# NastyLashy Wordpress Theme

## A Wordpress Theme made for my Fianceé's Lash Business.

Since I will be doing all the work on that website as a whole, a lot of things are implemented in the easiest way possible.
I wouldn't consider this theme a good portfolio project, but I still wanted it to be there in case anyone wants to see, how I solve things, if they need to be done fast and simple. Don't judge me please, I'm not happy with this myself...

This website will not grow a lot and will only have a handful of features, so I felt like trying to overengineer and overstructure things and code would have been overkill.

Also I wanted to be done with it ASAP because I promised my Fianceé I would do it.
